### Ideas
1. Every level consists of nine procedurally generated sublevels
2. Enemy characters are randomly distributed in each sublevel.They are the aims of a player to liquidate, using items they found in the first level of a game session
4. There are free types of weapon are in access for a player, and four types of enemy characters
5. (Bosses are also should be there, but they were not implemented)
6. In each level, there are shoprooms where players can buy randomly recommended power ups, which are kept with a player for an entire game session
7. (Not implemented, after pass of five bosses, appear in each odd level, the game is considered to be passed (the final scene is shown). Then it continuous in the infinity mode)
